                (Artistic Director & Founder)
            </div>
            <div class="text pad1-text">Ms Bloch was born in Durban, South Africa. At the young age of 10, she was accepted at the Durban Music & Ballet School training extensively under Duddley Von Loggenburg, Noleen Nicol and Faith Devilliers in the Cecchetti, Vaganova, and Bourneville styles of ballet. She was promoted to soloist within her first year, performing with the Natal Youth Ballet Company (1985-1990), dancing roles from Graduation Ball, Bourneville Suite, Sleeping Beauty, Jewels, Etudes, and Raymonda. Receiving many awards, bursaries, and achievements she chose to dance professionally and was accepted by PACT Ballet Company at the early age of 17, where she performed many traditional ballet classics such as: Giselle, Romeo & Juliette, Firebird, Le Papillon, La Fille Mal Gardée, War & Peace, various George Balanchine works, Nutcracker, and Swan Lake. She later went on to tour South Africa with the national musical, Queen at the Opera, which concluded her 8 year professional career in classical ballet.

                Ms Bloch taught classical ballet (ISTD Cecchetti Method) in South Africa for six years before moving to London, UK, in 1998, where she trained and worked as a Gyrotonic® Instructor assisting the rehabilitation of dancers to improve their strength and flexibility for further performance development. Ms Bloch furthered her knowledge and education in training young dancers, successfully taking the Associate and Associate Diploma ISTD Professional Ballet Teaching Examinations – Imperial Faculty (with Distinction). In March 2013 she was awarded her Licentiate with Distinction.

                    The Professional Training and Post Graduate Program is for the serious/full-time dancer aged 10 to 22 who is training to improve technical ability and artistic performance.
                    This program offers young dancers  the opportunity to showcase themselves as part of a Corps de Ballet  and as a Soloist. An audition is required to evaluate physical,
                    mental and emotional attributes needed for classical ballet together with a healthly medical history.
                    All professional students are required to take an ISTD ballet exam every year and offered the opportunity to participate in provincial,
                    national and international competitions. It is essential that students and parents are fully committed to
                    the teaching and guidance of the program in order to maintain its integrity.

                    This intense training program prepares boys and girls for a professional career in dance.<br><br>
                    <strong class="head">Foundation Training Program</strong><br>
                    The Foundation Training Program is for the amateur/part-time dancer aged 7-12yrs who loves to dance and  wants to work on poise, posture, and discipline together with technique,
                    musicality, and artistry. A minimum of twice a week is required and students (if ready) are encouraged to enter an ISTD ballet exam each year.
                    This program is designed to train young boys and girls to a higher level of ability,
                    offering them the opportunity to audition for the Professional Training Program.
                    Foundation students will participate in the year-end presentation on stage.</p>

                        The roots of Imperial Classical Ballet stem from the early days of the ISTD and the first written syllabus in 1913 which was based on
                        the teaching of the French School from the Paris Opéra. The syllabus has now evolved to promote the English classical style and addresses
                        the changing needs of Ballet dancers today. Students in both the Professional and Foundation training programs are encouraged to take an examination once a year.
                        ISTD Graded & Vocational exams are recognized internationally and acknowledged by the BC Ministry of Education, with Vocational certification awarding school credits.
                        <br><br>
                        <strong class="head">Pre-Ballet Program</strong><br>
                        Children aged 3-6yrs attend classes once or twice a week.  Our young ballerina program encourages age appropriate creativity, musicality, and physicality.
                        Children gain confidence, poise, and a solid frame work on which to build classical ballet technique.
                        The program offers boys and girls the opportunity to present informal in-house performances for their parents each term.
